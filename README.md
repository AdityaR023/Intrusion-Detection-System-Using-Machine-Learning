* L. Yang, A. Moubayed, and A. Shami, “MTH-IDS: A Multi-Tiered Hybrid Intrusion Detection System for Internet of Vehicles,” IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 2021.

## Implementation 
### Dataset 
CICIDS2017 dataset, a popular network traffic dataset for intrusion detection problems
* Publicly available at: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html  

For the purpose of displaying the experimental results in the sample code, the sampled subsets of CICIDS2017 is used. The subsets are in the "data" folder.
